# VirusTotal APK Scanner Guide

## Overview

The **VirusTotal APK Scanner** is a Python script that uploads and scans APK files using the **VirusTotal API** to detect malware and other security threats. This guide will walk you through setting up and using the script to ensure your APK files are safe.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- A **VirusTotal API Key**. You can get a free API key by signing up at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us).
- Install the necessary Python package, `requests`, by running:
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/apk-security-tools.git
   cd apk-security-tools
   ```

2. **Set your VirusTotal API Key** as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VT_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

3. Ensure the **VirusTotal Scan Script** (`virus_total_scan.py`) is available in your directory.

## Usage

To scan an APK file for malware using the VirusTotal API, use the following command:

```bash
python virus_total_scan.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
```

- **File Path**: Replace `/path/to/your/apkfile.apk` with the actual path to your APK file.
- The script will upload the APK file to VirusTotal, scan it, and return a **Scan Report URL** that you can use to check the results.

### Example Output:

```bash
Uploading and scanning 'your-apkfile.apk' with VirusTotal...
Scan successful!
Scan Report URL: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/xxxxx/detection
```

## Notes

- The **VirusTotal API** has rate limits for free API keys. If you need to scan multiple files quickly, you may need to upgrade your API plan.
- The scan results are stored on VirusTotal, and the report URL can be shared with others to view the scan results.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. API Key Missing Error:

If you see an error about the API key being missing, ensure that the **VT_API_KEY** environment variable is set correctly. You can check it with:
```bash
echo $VT_API_KEY
```

### 2. File Not Found Error:

If you receive an error indicating that the APK file was not found, verify that the path to the APK file is correct and the file exists in the specified location.

## Conclusion

This guide provides the steps to configure and use the VirusTotal APK Scanner script. Use it to scan APK files for potential malware and share the report URLs for transparency.
