### 1. **VirusTotal Scan Script**

This Python script will scan APK files using the VirusTotal API to check for malware or security threats.

**File Name:** `virus_total_scan.py`

```python
import requests
import os
import sys

# VirusTotal API Key from environment variables
API_KEY = os.getenv('VT_API_KEY')
VIRUSTOTAL_URL = 'https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/file/scan'

def scan_apk(file_path):
    """Uploads and scans an APK file using the VirusTotal API."""
    if not API_KEY:
        print("Error: VirusTotal API Key not found. Set your API key in the environment variable 'VT_API_KEY'.")
        sys.exit(1)

    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.")
        sys.exit(1)

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as apk_file:
        print(f"Uploading and scanning '{file_path}' with VirusTotal...")
        params = {'apikey': API_KEY}
        files = {'file': (file_path, apk_file)}
        response = requests.post(VIRUSTOTAL_URL, files=files, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Scan successful!")
        print("Scan Report URL:", response.json().get('permalink'))
    else:
        print(f"Error: Failed to scan APK. Status code: {response.status_code}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python virus_total_scan.py /path/to/apkfile.apk")
        sys.exit(1)

    scan_apk(sys.argv[1])
```

### Usage:
1. Save your **VirusTotal API key** in an environment variable named `VT_API_KEY`.
2. Run the script to scan your APK file:
   ```bash
   python virus_total_scan.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
   ```

# VirusTotal APK Scanner

## Overview

This Python script uses the **VirusTotal API** to scan APK files for malware and other security threats. Upload an APK file to VirusTotal, and the script will provide a report on the scan results, including whether any malware has been detected.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **VirusTotal API key** (Sign up at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) to get your free API key)
- Python packages: `requests`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/apk-security-tools.git
   cd apk-security-tools
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Set your VirusTotal API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VT_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Usage

To scan an APK file, use the following command:
```bash
python virus_total_scan.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
```

### Example Output:
```bash
Uploading and scanning 'your-apkfile.apk' with VirusTotal...
Scan successful!
Scan Report URL: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/xxxxx/detection
```

The script will return the URL to view the detailed report from VirusTotal.
