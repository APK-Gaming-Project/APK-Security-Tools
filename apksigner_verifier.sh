### **Key Features:**
- **APK Signature Verification**: This shell script uses the `apksigner` tool (part of Android SDK) to verify the integrity of APK files.
- **Error Handling**: Checks if the APK file and the `apksigner` tool are available, providing appropriate error messages if something is missing.
- **Simple Command-line Usage**: Run the script with an APK file path to check its signature.

### **Usage:**
1. Ensure **`apksigner`** is installed as part of the Android SDK build-tools and is available in your system's `PATH`.
2. Run the script to verify the APK signature:
   ```bash
   ./apksigner_verifier.sh /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
   ```

The script will print whether the APKâ€™s signature is valid or not.
