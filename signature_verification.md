# APK Signature Verification Guide

## Overview

The **APK Signature Verification Script** verifies the integrity of APK files using the **apksigner** tool from the Android SDK. This ensures that APK files have not been tampered with or modified since they were signed by the developer.

This guide will walk you through how to install the necessary tools, set up the script, and verify APK signatures.

## Prerequisites

Before running the signature verification script, make sure you have the following:

- **Android SDK Build-Tools**: The `apksigner` tool comes bundled with Android SDK build-tools. You can install it using Android SDK Manager.
- The **APK file** you want to verify.

### Installing Android SDK Build-Tools

If you haven't installed the Android SDK build-tools yet, you can install it with the following steps:

1. Install Android SDK Manager.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   sdkmanager --install "build-tools;<version>"
   ```

   Replace `<version>` with the latest version of build-tools.

3. Ensure the **`apksigner`** tool is in your system's `PATH` by running:
   ```bash
   apksigner --version
   ```

   This should output the version of `apksigner`, confirming that it's installed correctly.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where the **APK Signature Verification Script** (`verify_apk_signature.py`) is located.
   
2. Run the script with the APK file you want to verify:

   ```bash
   python verify_apk_signature.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
   ```

3. The script will output whether the APK signature is valid or not.

### Example Output:

```bash
Verifying APK signature for your-apkfile.apk...
APK signature verification successful!
```

If the signature verification fails, you'll see a message like this:

```bash
Error: APK signature verification failed!
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. `apksigner` Tool Not Found:

If you encounter an error that the `apksigner` tool is not found, make sure that the Android SDK build-tools are installed and that the tool is in your system’s `PATH`. You can check if `apksigner` is available by running:

```bash
apksigner --version
```

### 2. APK File Not Found:

Ensure that the APK file path is correct and that the file exists at the specified location. If the script cannot find the APK file, it will output an error like:

```bash
Error: APK file '/path/to/your/apkfile.apk' not found!
```

Verify the file path and try again.

## Best Practices for APK Signing

- **Always sign your APKs** before distributing them. Unsigned APKs may be rejected by Android devices and app stores.
- Use a **secure keystore** to sign your APKs. Keep your keystore and passwords secure to avoid unauthorized use.
- **Re-sign APKs** after modification to maintain integrity. Ensure that any modifications to APKs do not break the signature.

## Conclusion

The **APK Signature Verification Script** provides a simple way to verify the integrity of your APK files, ensuring they haven’t been tampered with after signing. For any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue in the repository or reach out to support.

Keep your APKs secure by regularly verifying signatures and using proper signing methods!
