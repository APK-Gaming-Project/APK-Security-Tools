# APK Signature Verification Script

## Overview

This Python script verifies the signature of an APK file using the **apksigner** tool from the Android SDK. It checks if the APK has been tampered with by verifying its digital signature, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the APK.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **apksigner** tool (Part of Android SDK, make sure it's installed and in your PATH)
- Python package: `subprocess` (Built-in with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/apk-security-tools.git
   cd apk-security-tools
   ```

2. Ensure that **apksigner** is installed. It comes with the Android SDK:
   ```bash
   sdkmanager --install "build-tools;<version>"
   ```

3. Make sure **apksigner** is in your system's PATH. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   apksigner --version
   ```

## Usage

To verify the signature of an APK file, run:
```bash
python verify_apk_signature.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
```

### Example Output:
```bash
Signature verification successful for 'your-apkfile.apk'!
```

If the signature is invalid or tampered with, the script will output an error message.
