### **Key Features:**
- **Static Analysis Placeholder**: This file outlines the structure for performing static analysis on APK files for common security issues such as:
  - Insecure permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`
  - Hardcoded sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords)
  - Weak encryption algorithms
- **Basic Structure**: The script currently includes placeholder functionality where actual static analysis logic can be implemented.

### **Usage:**
1. This script is a placeholder and requires further implementation. Once fully implemented, it could check APK files for various security vulnerabilities.
2. To run the basic script:
   ```bash
   python static_analysis_tool.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
   ```

This script can be further expanded by integrating libraries and logic to actually analyze the APK file contents.
