### **Key Features:**
- **Bash Script for Testing**: This script performs basic tests on the `obfuscate_apk.sh` script, ensuring it behaves as expected.
- **Test Cases**:
  - **Valid APK Test**: Simulates a valid APK file, ensuring the obfuscation script creates an obfuscated APK.
  - **Missing APK Test**: Ensures the script handles the case where the APK file is missing and fails gracefully.
  - **Missing ProGuard Test**: Simulates the absence of ProGuard by temporarily removing it from the `PATH`, testing the scriptâ€™s error handling.

### **How to Run the Tests:**
1. Ensure the `obfuscate_apk.sh` script and a valid ProGuard installation are present.
2. Run the test script using the following command:
   ```bash
   ./test_obfuscation.sh
   ```

The script will print the results of each test case.
