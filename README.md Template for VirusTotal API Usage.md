# VirusTotal APK Scanner

## Overview

This Python script uses the **VirusTotal API** to scan APK files for malware and other security threats. Upload an APK file to VirusTotal, and the script will provide a report on the scan results, including whether any malware has been detected.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **VirusTotal API key** (Sign up at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) to get your free API key)
- Python packages: `requests`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/apk-security-tools.git
   cd apk-security-tools
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Set your VirusTotal API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VT_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Usage

To scan an APK file, use the following command:
```bash
python virus_total_scan.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
```

### Example Output:
```bash
Uploading and scanning 'your-apkfile.apk' with VirusTotal...
Scan successful!
Scan Report URL: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/xxxxx/detection
```

The script will return the URL to view the detailed report from VirusTotal.
